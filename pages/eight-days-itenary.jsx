                      The excitement for today will be quite high as you make your way into the most celebrated wildlife park in the world – The Serengeti. 
                      After finishing up a good breakfast, you will head out towards the Serengeti National Park and travel in the midst of the never ending plain grasslands. 
                      The Serengeti means endless plains in the local African language and watching the grassland stretch out as far as the eye can see and eventually merging with the sky at the horizon is an absolutely breathtaking view. With an overall land area of 14,763 Square kilometers, it puts our notion about distance to shame. <br/><br/>
                      The Serengeti also houses the glorious “Big 5” (elephant, rhino, buffalo, lion and leopard). Along with the “Big 5”, a very pleasant sighting would be one of Africa’s most beautiful animal – The Impala. The Serengeti ecosystem supports the greatest remaining concentration of plains game in Africa. 
                      The legendary Serengeti National Park is the most renowned safari destination for its incredible population of lions and leopards. The central portion of the Serengeti – known as Seronera area is one of the richest wildlife habitats in the park. 
                      It features the Seronera River, which provides a valuable water source to this area and therefore attracts wildlife well representative of most of the Serengeti’s species. <br/><br/>
                      In Seronera, one must really look out for the many lion prides that thrive in this region. You must also look out for the Serengeti “Kopjes” which are massive boulders of granite standing in a sea of grass.
                      They provide ample shelter to a large variety of flora and fauna. A picnic lunch will be done during the day long game drive itself. The eventful day comes to an end with a heavy dinner and a good night’s rest in your accommodation.

                      In the months between mid-junes to September the migration can be found in this region. From mid-June to September, the Mara River in this region offers the most dramatic river crossing of the great migration. Fierce, deep and heavily rain fed the river takes an enormous toll on the migrating wildebeest. 
                      Watching the wildebeest surging through the torrential flow, some drowning and a few falling prey to lurking crocodiles is an unforgettable sight. <br/><br/>
                      If it’s your lucky day you will be able to witness this natural wonder and watch nature take its course.
                      Tracing the great migration you might even move towards the Lobo valley. The pristine lobo valley is scattered with woodlands, plains, hills and famous granite Kopjes.
                      It offers enormous amount of big cat game with lions, leopards and cheetah in plenty. <br/><br/>
                      During the dry season the permanent water sources in the valley attract plenty of resident and migratory animals, resulting in excellent game viewing. During the full day game drive, you will have a stop where you can have your picnic lunch.
                      The day comes to an end with a tasty dinner and a good rest in your choice of accommodation.
